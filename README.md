<h2>The PhantomX Arm Pincher</h2> 
<p>
The PhantomX Arm Pincher folder contains all the work that was done during the first sessions of robotics.
It contains several shots of the assembly of the robotic arm as well as the report explaining all the steps until operation.
</p>

<h2>The Bags</h2>
<p>
The bag folder contains all the bagfiles necessary for the proper functioning of the project. 
Indeed, thanks to these, each of the movements realized until then can be easily reengaged.
</p>

<h2>The project file (with Launch files and Scripts)</h2>
<p>
In the src / project file there are several subfolders. An important first is the one containing the Launchfiles. 
Indeed, we will find there the files thanks to which we will be able to call the scripts 
(which are in the file of the same name) that are written in Python language with the row $ roslaunch package_name file.launch. 
Once Launchfile is launched, the corresponding script will be used for the robot's movement.
</p>

<h2>The Map</h2>
<p>
The folder named Map contains a series of different attempts to create a map using the robot and the lidar.
The map chosen will be the one called "final_map.pgm". Thanks to this one, it is now easy to ask the robot to walk in the room 
corresponding to the map without being afraid of the obstacles.
</p>

<h2>RQT graphs</h2>
<p>
The rqt folder contains all graphs created as the project progresses. 
Indeed, these graphs model all the links that exist between the nodes of compilation of the actions and therefore of the 
files used in the good operation of the robot for a given action.
</p>

<h2>Report</h2>
<p>
And finally, you will find in the report folder all the elements necessary for the good realization of it, 
ie photos, videos and the report itself.
